# Attendance Management WebApp

The Attendance Management WebApp is a web-based application designed for faculty members to manage and track student attendance efficiently. The system allows faculty to create and manage classes, mark attendance, and monitor attendance statistics. Students can log in to check their individual attendance status. Built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and SQL, this application offers a seamless user experience with a responsive design.

This project was submitted as my Minor Project during the 6th semester of my B.Tech program. The application is integrated with AWS for server management, utilizing services like Amazon EC2 for hosting and Amazon S3 for storing related data. This application offers a seamless user experience with a responsive design.
